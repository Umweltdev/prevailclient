# our why

#  Understanding the nuances of marketing budgets and effective
#               strategies is essential to businesses. The costs associated with
#               marketing can vary significantly, contingent on factors like a
#               company's marketing budget, specific goals, and the number of
#               marketing channels they choose to employ. It is a well-established
#               industry guideline that businesses should allocate between 15% and
#               20% of their sales towards marketing expenses. However, the
#               ultimate allocation hinges on a company's unique budget size,
#               marketing strategy, ambition, and the manner in which it intends
#               to utilise its marketing resources. That is why understanding the
#               nuances of our market share, budgets, and effects is essential in
#               a companyâ€™s strategy to promote themselves to their right & unique
#               target audiences. Our paramount concern is the current trend where
#               large enterprises tend to dominate the digital landscape. They
#               often do so by employing full-time programmers and have the
#               financial capacity to invest in a plethora of SaaS solutions.
#               Regrettably, this trend leads to a rapid erosion of market share
#               for local businesses and SMEs, often catching them in financial
#               distress before they even realise it. The stark reality is that
#               local businesses and SMEs find it challenging to outcompete these
#               industry giants and are losing their market share within their
#               respective sectors.
