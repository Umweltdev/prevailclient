        normaltext1="We’ve seen many marketing channels and new tactics rise and fall in popularity over the years. But email marketing has stood the test of time, consistently driving remarkable results and ROI. It’s one of the most universal, flexible, and effective options available for brands."
        headerText2="Stay ahead of your competitors with automations"
        normaltext2="With e-mail automation, you have the opportunity to get ahead of the competition with messages that are automatically customized and sent out, depending on where the subscriber is in the buying journey. For example, it could be a welcome email to new subscribers. It can also be an information email about a product that a subscriber has looked at. Or it could be a gratitude email to a loyal customer. This will ensure repeat customers.
