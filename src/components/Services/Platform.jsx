              After this trigger event, consumers move into the initial
              consideration phase, where your ideal target audience thinks about
              brands or products that can meet their newly identified needs.

              marketing touchpoints can be challenging when trying to achieve a
              lasting impression on consumers to increase brand familiarity.
