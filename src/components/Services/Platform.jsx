              After this trigger event, consumers move into the initial
              consideration phase, where your ideal target audience thinks about
              brands or products that can meet their newly identified needs.
              Creating a consistent presence of your brand across all digital
              marketing touchpoints can be challenging when trying to achieve a
              lasting impression on consumers to increase brand familiarity.
