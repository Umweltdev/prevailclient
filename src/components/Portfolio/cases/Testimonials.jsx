            Salt has given me a lot of peace of mind, which is very important.
            We are much less stressed about running our business now that we
            know a full-fledged marketing team is carefully managing every
            aspect of our digital marketing. Itâ€™s like having your own marketing
            department, but without all the costs and problems that come with
            running one.
