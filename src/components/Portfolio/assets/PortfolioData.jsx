    text: "Understanding the nuances of marketing budgets and effective strategies is essential to businesses. The costs associated with marketing can vary significantly, contingent on factors like a company's marketing budget, specific goals, and the number of marketing channels they choose to employ. It is a well-established industry guideline that businesses should allocate between 15% and 20% of their sales towards marketing expenses. However, the ultimate allocation hinges on a company's unique budget size, marketing strategy, ambition, and the manner in which it intends to utilise its marketing resources. That is why understanding the nuances of our market share, budgets, and effects is essential in a company’s strategy to promote themselves to their right & unique target audiences. Our paramount concern is the current trend where large enterprises tend to dominate the digital landscape. They often do so by employing full-time programmers and have the financial capacity to invest in a plethora of SaaS solutions. Regrettably, this trend leads to a rapid erosion of market share for local businesses and SMEs, often catching them in financial distress before they even realise it. The stark reality is that local businesses and SMEs find it challenging to outcompete these industry giants and are losing their market share within their respective sectors.",
